Some such bodies that are captured in the planets gravity well become the most common type of meteorite by (whether quickly, or after many orbits) arriving on a trajectory toward the planets surface. Estimates for their contribution to the total meteorite population vary between 85.7%[2] and 86.2%.')">
        <img class="a" onclick="openImg(2,'Iron-Meteorite','Iron meteorites, also known as siderites, or ferrous meteorites, are a type of meteorite that consist overwhelmingly of an iron–nickel alloy known as meteoric iron that usually consists of two mineral phases: kamacite and taenite. Most iron meteorites originate from cores of planetesimals,[2] with the exception of the IIE iron meteorite group[3]The iron found in iron meteorites was one of the earliest sources of usable iron available to humans, due to the malleability and ductility of the meteoric iron,[4] before the development of smelting that signaled the beginning of the Iron Age.')">
        <img class="a" onclick="openImg(3,'Achondrite','An achondrite[1] is a stony meteorite that does not contain chondrules.[2][3] It consists of material similar to terrestrial basalts or plutonic rocks and has been differentiated and reprocessed to a lesser or greater degree due to melting and recrystallization on or within meteorite parent bodies.[4][5] As a result, achondrites have distinct textures and mineralogies indicative of igneous processes.[6]Achondrites account for about 8% of meteorites overall, and the majority (about two-thirds) of them are HED meteorites, possibly originating from the crust of asteroid 4 Vesta.')">
